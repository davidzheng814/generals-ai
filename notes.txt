"Map generation algorithm" - ugh
Cities and Mountains both show up in fog of war as Obstacles
"More variation in map sizes"

There are half-turns, turns, and rounds
	Rounds = every 25 turns
	You can move units every half-turn
	Generators (towers/villages/cities) and generals = one unit per turn
	Owned squares = one unit per round
Units
	Movement will always leave at least one unit on the square
	Moving a 2 strength army against an enemy army of strength 1 will kill the enemy army but leave the enemy with control of the tile
	Neutral generators always regenerate up to 40 (but spawn with units between 40 and 50)
Move Priority
	If player A has move priority over player B, player A's move will execute first over player B's
	Move priority between any two players alternates every move / half-turn
